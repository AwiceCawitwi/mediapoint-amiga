Chris,

I read your bug report regarding the GVR, and I immediately changed
it to make it work in the player. I should have tested this, my apologies
for the mistake.

Do this to fix it:

1. Change in serial.c the function UA_MakeFullPath into MakeFullPath.
2. Delete geninit.o, use the included general.o instead.
3. Remove the KPrintF in setup.c

What was wrong: serial.c called a function (UA_MakeFullPath) in the
mediapoint.library (all functions in this lib start with UA_). The
library though is not available when playing the script. Therefore I
have made for the xapps a small file with a few frequently used functions.
By mistake I used the library version of MakeFullPath instead of the one
in general.o.
