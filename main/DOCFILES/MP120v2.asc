Changes in MP 120

Important remark:

	Loose lips, sink ships!!!!!

Player

·	MediaLink TimeCode removed from the Timer Object. HHMMST, SMPTE 
and MIDI remain.
·	Mouse pointer doesn't 'hang' any more (the tall vertical bar which 
appeared sometimes).
·	The objects buffer (the place where all script objects are cached during 
play) can be remembered during playing/stopping the script. Speeds up 
working/testing a lot.
·	The cursor keys repeat now instead of accepting only one press.
·	A timecode (hardware) card is supported by a custom timer (a timer like 
the SMPTE timer). This means that you can sync a VTR with a script. 
Ask for more details.
·	The transitions work better on systems with little (chip) ram. Goal is
still to let MP run on stock 1200 with 2 MB of chip ram and no fast ram. At 
least the player should work fine on such systems. The script and page 
editor require a minimum of 1 Mb of chip and 2 Mb fast or 2 Mb of chip 
and 1 MB of fast. Whether 1.3 will be supported is uncertain. It will take 
us time to check everything under 1.3 and as it seems now it isn't 
necessary any more. It will save a substantial amount of coding if we 
go for >=2.0 completely. Let us know if you disagree!!!! Ask your 
users/clients/friends what they think/use.


Preferences

·	Language: currently English, Dutch, German, Italian. Shipped version 
will also include Spanish, Portuguese, French, Danish, Swedish and 
Norwegian.
·	Menus and player screen mode: PAL, NTSC, DBLPAL, DBLNTSC, 
SUPER72. Player screen mode not used yet.
·	Screen modes and language can be changed on the fly.
·	Thumbnails in 8, 16 and 32 colors (yes: colors, not grayscales!).
·	Stand-by mode (asks to press the left mouse button or a key before 
starting the script).
·	Player input choices: Mouse (next/prev pic with right and left mouse 
button), cursor keys, mouse AND cursor or no input at all.
·	Mouse pointer can be left on (a fat mouse pointer is shown, which can be 
used to point out important things during a presentation).
·	More color sets to choose from (bloody important huh?).
·	Expert Mode removed from prefs.
·	New page transitions: overshoot effects on pushes, reveals and covers. 
·	Objects transitions can wait until the space bar is pressed (set the player 
options to 'manual').

Xapps

·	All xapps have been tested and modified. They should not hang any 
more when the hardware for which the xapp is written is not available. 
You can sniff but not work with the xapp in such cases.
·	All xapps with serial communication have in their .info files information 
regarding the serial device, unit and speed (this has been done with 
multi IO cards in mind).
·	Sample xapp. Features are: playing from disk (needs only a very small 
chip memory buffer), fading, balance control, stopping, volume control, 
stereo channels.


Script Editor

·	Parallel branches have a 'time line'. This makes it easier to see how the 
events follow each other up. Looks great!
·	The thumbnails also show the first frame of an animation (test this by 
dragging the anim object into the script and press in the file requester the 
button with the small squares).
·	Most 'Play', 'Preview', 'Show' and 'Edit' buttons work.
·	Requesters pop up on a SINGLE mouse click. Duration, effect, object and 
xapp windows appear at a single click. Double clicking only remains to 
modify the comment field of a branch, label or xapp. 
·	The effects and duration requesters work asynchronous. This means 
that you can drag, select, deselect, shift-select alt-select and select all 
object and scroll the script while you are in one of these requesters.
·	F1-F6 sets the preferred duration for any selected object in the script. 
Notice that the small box underneath the xapp scroll box is gone.
·	The Timer object has changed. The preload options are scaled down to 
only 'All objects', 'All after a label' and 'None'. The play options are 
'Automatic' and 'Manual' and player memory is 'Keep' and 'Flush' (see 
earlier remark about caching script objects). The string gadget in the 
Timing type list now accepts a name. This can be the name of a custom 
timer (custom timers are placed in the System drawer of MP).
·	A special time code tweaker can be used to alter timecodes in frame 
code scripts or parallel branches. F7 brings you to this magic menu (first 
select at least 3 script objects). Options are: setting the starting, ending, 
offset and delta of the frame codes.

Page Editor

·	'Use palette of imported picture' can be undone.
·	Window refreshing improved up by a factor 2, chip memory usage 
scaled down considerably. 1 meg systems with 2 Mb fast can be used 
now.
·	Pictures can be scaled and remapped an unlimited number of times.

·	Clips are never saved when it's not necessary (earlier betas saved 
pictures too soon, sometimes when they were not even scaled or 
remapped).
·	More windows can be opened (50).
·	Import makes the windows it opens transparent and no longer stacks but 
tiles them. This makes it faster and you have a better overview of what 
you've loaded (try it: select all the MP clipart and watch!).
·	A background is added to the import requester. A background, 
obviously, lies in the background and windows can be opened on top of 
it. Users find this easier than having to open a window. Opening a 
picture (the open you use to load a page) creates a background when 
the file you open is an IFF file and not a page (aka document).
·	Import a picture now also accepts animations. You get the first frame of 
the animation (datatypes will give you, one day, the option to select 
any frame from an animation but Commodore forgot to implement this).
·	The datatypes are still under construction.
·	Crawl text is also cut/copied/pasted. Upcoming change will be that you 
can convert a typed text into a crawl by going to the crawl menu and 
clicking on OK. The window will move and resize itself, becoming as 
wide as the screen and as tall as the used font. This will give a better 
look where the crawling will take place.
·	An extra menu item 'Color' has been added to the 'Text' menu (formerly 
the Font menu). This frees the Palette menu item from a double (and 
unclear) function. Now Palette only and always shows the color palette 
and 'Color' allows you to change the text color. 
·	The font requester doesn't automatically show the selected font. Click on 
the sample box to preview the font. Double clicking on a font size loads 
the font. Going to the font requester selects the font currently used (I'm 
not sure if this is new to 120).
·	The text editor no longer flashes the whole screen when making a 
selection range (happened only on certain systems running under 
37.175).
·	Although around for some time (I think), palettes can be loaded and 
saved in the palette requester. Any one using the broadcast limits?
·	Windows can be locked/unlocked with a short cut (A-K).
·	Save requester also has a home button.

·	The file requester now responds to single clicks on a directory, volume, 
assign and home dir. Also: make your own homes, they're REALLY 
handy!
·	Besides @DATE, @MONTH etc. you can also include a text @FILE in a 
window. Note that the @ commands work in a window but also in a 
scroll text! Press Help when you're in the string gadget of the crawl to get 
a special requester.
·	Does any one know about the different transition requesters? Hold down 
shift while selecting 'Transitions' from the page editor Misc menu and 
you get a requester in which ingoing AS WELL AS outgoing object 
transitions can be defined. Pretty neat, huh?
·	Has anyone discovered the Help button? Press it in the Page Editor or 
Script Editor and you get an overview of all the short cuts. Pressing Help 
in the text editor present you with a requester in which special 
characters can be inserted (like ‘). It also can be used to include @ 
commands. This literals requester can also be called up in the string 
requester of the crawl requester.
