Bugs found in MediaPoint:

* In filerequester:
 It looks like the position of the brushes are also relative to the left of
the  screen.   Try  pressing  outside to the left of the requester, and you
will see what I mean.

Possible Bugs in TRANS:
* I don't known what's wrong.  First I tried to translate my languages, and
thought I might have done something wrong.  Then I tried to translate the
Netherlands - language.  I didn't work either.  When I started my program
with my own Netherlands - made language, everything was just a mess.  I am
almost sure I have followed the instruction right.

Since I don't have the manual, one question :

Is it possible to put a text or a brush on a event after it has been
executed by the command "SHOW"?.  I know you can edit it in the editor
after it has been shown, but that's not what I mean.  I want everything to
be controlled by ARexx.  When the user runs the script, he should be able
to press a key, and then put brush or text upon the present
picture-information already visible.  I hope you understand what I mean.
Here some examples:

Example1:

I have a very big script.  When I press the key 'P', I want to show the
letter, or brush P in the top right corner.  I want this to indicate
'PAUSE'.  I do not want to make an extra page for every event, just to
include the case when the user presses the 'P'-key.

Example2:

I want to let a brush in the top right corner of the screen, indicate that
the machine has received my message, and is working on a selected action.

Example3:

I want 4 numbers to always be present in the top right corner of the
screen.  If the user suddenly presses the 'j'-key, I want the user to input
a new number.  The new numbers, as the user enter them should be show on
top of my previous picture/animation, or what ever, real time.  I repeat:
I do not want to make 2 or more versions of every event.

Why do I ask?

Well, in ScalaMM, it's impossible to put a text on a event, if the user has
already seen the picture.  There, I have to setup the page from the
beginning, including my new text and then execute SHOW.  This is a bad
thing, if your last event included an animation, or an effect.  You just
have to see the hole animation once again.  I know these things are
possible in AmigaVision.


Please:  If you have read this letter, answer it, or give me a short notice
if you dont't have the time.



What I think about your program:

First the negative sides(sorry):

Well, I am missing the shuffler (Scala). 

I like your smal pictures in the filerequester.  It's fast.  But why not
have a dragbar instead of 'Next' and 'Prev'.

Why are you dividing everything into several scripts?  It would be much
nicer if everything could be in one script (like in Scala (again)).  I
don't want 9000 files on my Harddrive, and it complicates edition in
CygnusED.

Oops.  You have missed the colour-fonts.  I like colour fonts.

I want better help support (I know it's not finished yet).  Why not use
AmigaGuide?

I want animbrushes (supported by AmigaVision).

I want better control of the animplayer.  I want to be able to start the
animation at frame 6, and end it at frame 19, and then let it play 10
times.

I want to text an animation (take a look at Scala).

Why can't I run an event directly in the page editor?

I dont want to run the entire script, if I just want to see the 3 last
pages.

You have not supported 24 bits import yet. I want it.

Please implement commands in MediaPoint, to let external programs grab the
screen.  I need it.

What about a link to DPaint, just like in AdPro?

When you have to picture with 128 color or less, you should open a screen
with depth big enough to include palette in both the pictures.  Result:
Much better color transitions.

You have missed superimpose!

I want to make a text 3D and outline at the same time.

I want support for the standard amiga edition (Amiga X to delete, and so on)

In the color requester I want the "pick" option(you know, choose a color
from the picture, just by clicking on it.

Are you sure you are supporting max overscan completly?

I want my own mouse pointer back!

I want a resizeable filerequester!

I want to setup my 'home' directories inside the filerequester, and not in
prefs.

I want a show, and a edit button on screen istead of first clicking on the
event, then choosing 'show' or 'edit'.

I want to be able to place the screen on my monitor just like in CygnusEd
and DPaint (CTRL SHIFT arrows).  It is very useful in connection with
Video.

Amiga is a multitasking machine.  Why don't you multitask the
font-list-loading.

I would like a own function, just to move things around.  When I have many
brushes on the screen at the same time, your method takes time.

Then the positive sides:

I like your page editor.  Opening a screen in 64 colour, and then loading a
background in 16 or 256 colour is just nice.

You have support for many devices. Good.

And the best:  You don't need a dongle to play the script when finished.  I
would recommend you to let the user need a dongle to use the editor!

Supported screengrabbing is OK.

Your easy way of making a 3D-button is good.  It makes interactive scripts
much easier.

I don't think it's necessary to be compatible to kick1.3.  I don't think
kick1.3 users are interested in buying MediaPoint.  Let them buy a better
Amiga first.  Kickstart 1.3 is OUT!

Well, that's all for this time.  I hope this wasn't to much.  I have not
tested MediaPoint for a long time, so I don't know all about it features.
So I might have mentioned some things above, that is allready implemented
in a way or another.  Sorry then.
