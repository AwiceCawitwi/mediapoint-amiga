                     How the translation works
                     -------------------------

The following files are used in the translation process:

alltexts            --> ASCII file which contains all languages LINE BY LINE.
texts.English       --> special file with only the English lines extracted.
texts.Nederlands    --> special file with only the Dutch lines extracted
                        (example).
texts.YOUR_LANGUAGE --> special file with only the lines extracted in YOUR
                        language (THIS FILE WILL BE MADE BY YOU!).
trans               --> program which extracts lines from 'alltexts' into
                        a texts file.

MediaPoint uses a separate file which contains all the texts used in the
program and the xapps. With MediaPoint a German, French etc. version
of this translation file will be bundled, making it possible for the user
to choose his preferred language.

The translation is made in a normal ASCII file (called 'alltexts') which
must be transformed into a special language file. This is done by the
program 'trans'. This program extracts from the file 'alltexts' the
lines of 1 language and stores them into a separate file called 'texts'.
The program trans will append to the filename 'texts' the name of your
language (e.g. texts.Deutsch, texts.Español etc.). These 'texts' files
are copied to the system directory of MediaPoint. The preferences of
MediaPoint can be used to select the preferred language. 

Let's take a look at a few lines as they appear in the file 'alltexts': 

1 "OK"
2 "OK"
1 "Cancel"      --> This is English (I bet you already knew that...)
2 "Annuleer"    --> This is 'Cancel' in Dutch (strange word, ain't it?)
1 "More"
2 "Meer"

At the top of the file 'alltexts' you can see which number your language
has. Let's assume that you are going to make the german translation, which
has code 3. This means that after all the lines starting with 2, you will
insert a line with code 3:

1 "OK"
2 "OK"
3 "OK"          --> this line is inserted
1 "Cancel"
2 "Annuleer"
3 "Abbrechen"   --> this line is inserted
1 "More"
2 "Meer"
3 "Mehr"        --> this line is inserted

Lines with code 0 must not be translated, they contain texts which should
be the same, regardless the language you're using.

While translating you must keep the following things in mind:

- The translated word should be of about the same size as the English word.
- The translation should follow the Locale version of the word as used
  by the Workbench (at least the words OK, Cancel, Open, Save etc. should
  be the same).
- You'll sometimes notice that the same word appears twice in the list
  (in the future we'll clean up this list). Make these words the same for
  now.
- Spell the words right!

Another important issue are the cycle buttons (the buttons which offer
e.g. 10 options when you press the @ character on the button:

  +---+-----------+
  | @ |  640×512  |   --> this is a cycle button
  +---+-----------+

The options for these cycle buttons are stored in a long string. The
string looks like this:

1 "Landscape|       Landscape 4x4|   Portrait|        Portrait 4x4|    "
2 "Liggend|         Liggend 4x4|     Staand|          Staand 4x4|      "
 /*-----------------+++++++++++++++++-----------------+++++++++++++++++*/

Assume again that the German translation is inserted. You must be very
careful in NOT using tabs, ending the word with a '|' character and
not forgetting any white spaces. Also the length of the words are
important.

1 "Landscape|       Landscape 4x4|   Portrait|        Portrait 4x4|    "
2 "Liggend|         Liggend 4x4|     Staand|          Staand 4x4|      "
3 "Quer|            Quer 4x4|        Normal|          Normal 4x4|      "
 /*-----------------+++++++++++++++++-----------------+++++++++++++++++*/

When your finished with the translation, you can use the program 'trans'
to create the real translation. The German version can be created as
follows:

E.g. "trans alltexts 1" will create a file "texts.English"
-------------------------------------------------------------------

> Type: trans alltexts 3

The following will be printed on screen:

> Written translation to 'texts.Deutsch'

You see that 'trans' appends '.Deutsch' to 'texts', showing you that you
used the right code for your translated lines.

When your MediaPoint is stored on 'work:MediaPoint' you can type 
'copy texts.Deutsch work:MediaPoint/System'. DON'T FORGET THIS!!!!!!

These last two steps (running trans and copying the file) can be done
as many times as needed. After testing MediaPoint you can go back
to modify 'alltexts' and repeat these steps. Don't forget to quit
MediaPoint in order to reload the texts file.

After that you can test MediaPoint. Don't forget to set the desired 
language in the preferences! Testing MediaPoint means that you'll have
to call up all requesters and xapps, this is a lot of work and we'll
understand that you may not be able find all texts at this moment (some
texts only appear in stress situations). Therefore it is important to
send the files to us as soon as possible, so that we also can test it over
here.

Thank you very much for investing time and effort in MediaPoint!
