                    Note to the translators of MediaPoint
                    =====================================

Enclosed in this readme you'll find a few lines taken from the 'alltexts'
file. Copy these lines and paste them in your 'alltexts' at the bottom.
The change has to do with update ß 118 in which a language can be chosen
in the MediaPoint preferences window.

Important: to be fully 'localized' in MediaPoint you need of course a text
file in your own language (that's what the translators are doing right
now!) but you also have to set the Workbench locale to your own country 
and language else you end up with a MediaPoint in your own language but
with, for instance, an English date and time formatting.

These lines should be added to the bottom of your 'alltexts' file:

/* misc stuff */

1 "The language %s is not available. Switching back to %s."
2 "De taal %s is niet aanwezig. De taal %s zal gebruikt worden."
1 "Changing the language will only take effect next time you start %s."
2 "Herstart %s om de taalverandering te gebruiken."

By the way: if you didn't start on the translation yet and if you're
wondering how to alter the 'alltexts' file, the Commodore 'ed' program
will do, or any other text editor or word-processor as long as it
saves in plain ASCII.
